x == 5	true	
x == "5"	true	
===	equal value and equal type	x === 5	true	
x === "5"	false	
!=	not equal	x != 8	true	
!==	not equal value or not equal type	x !== 5	false	
x !== "5"	true	
x !== 8	true	
>	greater than	x > 8	false	
<	less than	x < 8	true	
>=	greater than or equal to	x >= 8	false	
<=	less than or equal to	x <= 8	true
JAVASCRIPT OPERATORS (IF x=6 and y=3)
&&	and	(x < 10 && y > 1) is true	
||	or	(x == 5 || y == 5) is false
